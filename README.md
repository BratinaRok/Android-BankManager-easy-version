## Important

Your project will be reviewed in many different stages of the project creation. The author should
be available for receiving e-mail messages and also for receiving open-issues on github.

If a issue is opened on github the author should acknowledge having read the issue by responding to it
with some comment.
The acknowledgement comment may also be used to 'make questions/make comments' about the issue.
A comment indicating a possible solution for the issue before actually fixing the issue is welcomed.
After making the commit fixing the issue, make a comment to indicate that the issue is fixed, 
but don't close the issue yourself, let the staff member close it if he really think the issue is solved.

It is also a good practice to open issues yourself for problems you identify. 
If you are having problem solving an issue by yourself try asking for help from staff members.
